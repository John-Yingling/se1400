                        Imperial Legion
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Imperial Legion is the army of the Septim Empire. They are a crucial part of the Civil War questline in Skyrim and are one of the 
                            joinable sides. In Skyrim you learn that the Legion had lost and won battles against the Aldmeri Dominion, eventually leading to a
                            treaty being signed between the two agreeing to a very shaky alliance. The was called the White-Gold Concordat, after the White-Gold 
                            tower in the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. One of the stipulations the Dominion had was to outlaw the worship of Talos, a man named Tiber 
                            Septim who had became a god. The Empire felt they had no choice to sign the treaty to end the bloodshed for now. However, the nords of
                            Skyrim were outraged. Particularly a man named Ulfric Stormcloak who would later create the other option for the Civil War questline, 
                            the aptly named Stormcloak Rebellion. If you side with the Imperial Legion and the Empire, you will storm garrisons, take cities, rise 
                            the ranks, and eventually seige the capitol of the Stormcloak Rebellion, Windhelm. After the seige and Ulfric is dead, Skyrim starts to 
                            reset with help of the Legion and if you talk to the general, General Tullius, he makes a comment about taking another fight to the Dominion.

                    <h3>
                        Stormcloak Rebellion
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Stormcloak Rebellion is the rebellion created by Ulfric Stormcloak, a former agent of the empire who took back Markarth from 
                            a rouge group called the Forsworn. That would later be called the Markarth Incident and would prove Ulfrics worth to the Empire, but
                            the Dominion would later forcibly imprison him because of his worship of Talos. While in prison Ulfrics father died. He wasn't allowed 
                            by the Dominion to go and see his father or even go to his funeral. For this, many people sympathize with Ulfric. Ulfric and his rebellion
                            reside in Windhelm, a city in the northeast of Skyrim. In Ulfrics quest to bring Skyrim to a free state away from the Empire and more 
                            importantly the Dominion, he went to Solitude, the capitol of Skyrim to challenge High King Torygg for his crown. He won using the power of
                            his voice, an ability to shout words in the language of the dragons, allowing men to breathe fire and many other things. Ulfric returned to
                            Windhelm calling himself the True High King of Skyrim. Only the people that supported the rebels acknowlegded this title, but to everyone else,
                            the title of High King went to Torygg's wife, Elisif. If you choose to side with the rebels, it is similar to the Empire. You'll storm garrisons,
                            take cities, rise ranks, and eventually seige Solitude, killing General Tullius and beginning Skyrims track to freedom from the Empire and the Dominion.

                        Aldmeri Dominion
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Aldmeri Dominion, also known as the Thalmor, are an organization created by the high elves in the Summerset Isles after the Oblivion Crisis. The
                            altmer blamed the Empire for the crisis and believed they had failed all of Tamriel and very quickly rose in power, rivaling the Empire themselves. 
                            The Dominion waged war on the Empire with each side dealing blows to the other. The battles were bloody, but both sides begrudgingly came together and
                            signed the White-Gold Concordat, as previously mentioned. The Dominion are all about elven supremacy and political and world domination. While they
                            aren't joinable in the events of Skyrim, they play a major part of the story. One mission in the main storyline involves breaking into the Thalmor 
                            Embassy near Solitude. In this process, you find documents that reveal that the Thalmor are secretly aiding the Stormcloaks to keep the war going and 
                            keep the Empire distracted. Their true goals are to eventually break down to towers that hold reality together and return things back to an aetherial
                            state as they believed that the mortal plane was a mistake.

                        <p>
                            The Penitus Oculatus are the Emperor's personal guard. They were formed after the Blades, basically the same thing, were dispanded due to the White-Gold
                            Concordat. They are the direct opposition to the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim. During the events of Skyrim they are lead by Commander Maro, and depending on
                            the choices you make, you can either join them (kind of), and kill the Dark Brotherhood, or the more fun option. Join the Dark Brotherhood and kill the Emperor
                            and leave the Penitus Oculatus in shambles.

                        Dark Brotherhood
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Dark Brotherhood is an assassin organization that operates all throughout Tamriel. Their rivals historically are the Morag Tong, more on them later.
                            The Dark Brotherhood is said to be originally apart of the Morag Tong, splintering off with the ascension of the Night Mother. The Night Mother is the 
                            supposed lover of Sithis, a being that is considered to be not a deity of any kind, but instead a force, a void. Sithis and the Night Mother had five 
                            children and Sithis, in the Night Mothers head, told her to send their children to him. This unfortunately meant sacrificing the children. Most of this is
                            speculation. Some believe that the Night Mother and Sithis are all just Mephala in disguise, she is the daedric prince of lies, sex, murder, and secrets.
                            Regardless, during the events of Skyrim, to join the Dark Brotherhood, you must go to Windhelm and find a child named Aventus Arentino who wants help killing
                            the cruel old lady who owns Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. Her name is Grelod the Kind. Irony plays a big part here, as she is not. In the orphange you can 
                            find a room with cuffs on the wall, looking like a sort of dungeon. When you fisrt enter the orphanage Grelod is berating the children and even tells them
                            that no one wants them and they won't be adopted. This makes it very easy to want to assassinate her. If you do so, you return to Aventus, tell him, he rewards 
                            you and you think thats that. However, days later you get an ominous note (see left). Once you read the note and sleep in a bed, you wake up kidnapped in a creepy
                            cabin with the leader of the Dark Brotherhood starting to talk to you. From here you kill her and go talk to Commander Maro of the Penitus Oculatus and then kill
                            the rest of the brotherhood, but that's the less fun option. Astrid, the leader, will ask you to kill one of three people with possible contract. They all are
                            have reasons to have a contract on them so you can kill all of them, but it doesn't really matter. Once you do this, you go to the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in
                            Falkreath. You meet everyone complete a couple contracts and then meet Cicero. Then things start getting interesting. Astrid thinks Cicero is conspiring with
                            someone to take her down so she has you hide in the Night Mothers coffin and that is when you find out you are the Listener. You then get a contract to kill the
                            emperor, Titus Mede II. After completing a couple missions, including killing the emperors neice at her wedding, Cicero goes nuts, not that he wasn't already,
                            and you are sent to go kill him. You can either do so or not, doesn't effect the stroy in any way. After this, you can continue on the mission adn try to kill the 
                            emperor, but discover Astrid sold you out to Commander Maro to save the brotherhood, but he doesn't live up to his end and kills everyone except Nazir and Babette.
                            After going to the sanctuary and finding it burnt to the ground, you, Nazir, and Babette rebuild the brotherhood in Dawnstar and succeed at killing the emperor.

                        Thieves Guild
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Thieves Guild is an organization that primarily does business in, suprise, theft. The leader of the Thieves Guild is usually someone known as the Grey Fox.
                            The Grey Fox is a mysterious figure as the person that dons the cowl disappears. Not literally though, you can physically see them and touch them, but the 
                            identity of the person disappears entirely from history. The reason for this is because the cowl originally belonged to the daedric prince Nocturnal, god of
                            theft, shadows, and patron of thieves. Nocturnal was summoned by witches and she took her cowl off and it was stolen by a near by thief after using a younger
                            thief as a distraction. After this he dons the cowl, activating the curse in the process. In the The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, near the end of the Thieves 
                            Guild questline you help the current Gray Fox, Corvus Umbranox, the Count of Anvil, who had went "missing" 10 years ago, lift the curse from the cowl and he 
                            gives the cowl to the player, making you the new Grey Fox, but no curse. During the events of Skyrim, you ca join the Thievs Guild by going to Riften and get
                            approached by a man named Brynjolf. Brynjolf will offer a job to you to plant a ring on someone. No matter if the player succeeds or not, he talks about how 
                            the guild has been going through some bad luck recently. After going through the ratway, the sewer of Riften, you find the Ragged Flaggon, a front for the guild
                            with the cistern being their main operation and hidden behind a dresser in the flaggon. After doing a couple jobs for various people, Maven Black-Briar, Sabjorn,
                            you discover a hidden player, Karliah, thought to have betrayed the guild. You go to a ruin with Mercer Frey, the current leader of the guild though not the Grey Fox,
                            and discover that Mercer had lied and he actually betrayed the guild. Karliah, Brynjolf, and the player go to Nocturnal and become Nightingales, agents of Nocturnal.
                            She sends you to take down Mercer and return what he stole, the Skeleton Key, a object that is able to pick any lock. You follow Mercer to a dwarven ruin housing the
                            Eyes of the Falmer, ancient artifact of the snow elves, two giant crystals. You take Mercer down and can steal the eyes for yourself and you have the option of returning
                            the key to the Twilight Sepulcher. You can also become the guild master of the Thieves Guild if you do enough jobs.

                            The Morag Tong , like the Dark Brotherhood, are an organiztion of assassins that operate in Morrowind. The Morag Tong operate differently than the Dark Brotherhood.
                            Their assassinations are called "writs" and are actually legal meaning that no one can stop them once a writ is issued. The are used by Morrwinds government, which
                            is what makes them legally binding. During the events of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, the Morag Tong are in a war against the Dark Brotherhood and eventually 
                            kill the Night Mother and leader of the Dark Brotherhoods Morrwind chapter. After the eruption of Red Mountain, the Morag Tong were forced to scatter and vowed
                            to reunite one day. During the events of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the Morag Tong make a brief appearance in the Dragonborn DLC on the island of Solstheim, an 
                            island that used to be apart of Skyrim, but detached and eventually became apart of Morrowind. You discover that they were hired by members of House Hlaalu to kill
                            Lleril Morvayn of House Redoran and current leader of Raven Rock. The player gets the opprotunity to stop this plan and kill the rest of the Morag Tong.

                            The Companions trace back all the way Ysgramor and his 500 companions he brought to Skyrim to defeat the snow elves. They are based out of Whiterun in Skyrim, in a 
                            place called Jorvaskr that was built by the original 500. They fight with honor, help defend Skyrim, and also offer services to help people with problems they have.
                            No politics, no judgments, just business. While the up front of The Companions is a group of warriors, the highest member, known as the inner circle, are secretly 
                            werewolves. They had been cursed a couple hundred years ago by coven of hagravens, half bird, half human witches that swore their life to Hircine, daedric prince of
                            the hunt. During the events of Skyrim, you can join The Companions by talking to Kodlak Whitemane, the Harbinger, leader, of The Companions. You face a combat challenge 
                            to join them and when you succeed you do a few jobs, go to a few dungeons, and eventually joion the inner circle and have the choice to become a werewolf yourself, it's 
                            honeslty kind cool. You start to help deal with the Silver Hand, a group of people who hate the companions because of their connection to Hircine, and help gather the 
                            fragments of Wuuthrad, a legendary axe owned by Ysgramor himself. Approaching the end of the story, Kodlak asks you to help cure his lycanthropy with obatining the heads
                            of the witches that cursed them in the first place. Kodlak dies before he is able to be cured, but you find out that you still can achieve his wishes by going to Ysgramor's
                            tomb. You help cure him and become the Harbinger of The Companions.

                        <p>
                            The College of Winterhold is an institution for mages and arcane scholars in Skyrim. The College sits very dramatically on a cliff over the Sea of Ghosts.
                            The town of Winterhold went through an event called the Great Collapse in which the cliffs above the Sea of Gifts collpased and fell into the sea, taking most of Winterhold
                            with it. No one really knows the cause of the Great Collapse, but the College theorizes it coudl be some sort of result of eruption of Red Mountain, but that happened 117 
                            years before the collapse. The citizens of Winterhold blame the College for the collapse, but the Arch-Mage, the leader of the College, swears they had nothing to do with it.
                            To join them all you have to is approach the front gates and you will be asked to cast a spell, it's random. You start off as a novice and progressively rise the ranks. You
                            You find a big mystical ball called the Eye of Magnus in Saarthal. A group called the Psijic order approaches you and ominously tell you that dangerous events are about to 
                            transpire. Eventually you go to a massive nord ruin called The Labrynthian and obtain the Staff of Magnus as well as discovering a plot made by a Thalmor agent named Ancano

                            The Dawnguard an order of vampire hunters that had been lost to the ages until The Elder Scrolls V when they are trying to be resurrected to fight the recent growing menace of 
                            the vampires. The history of the Dawnguard is surrounded by a lot of rumors and hearsay. The Jarl of Riften in the 2nd Era had an overly confident son that contracted vampirism
                            during one of his adventures. The Jarl couldn't bring himself to kill his own son so he built what is now the base of operations of the Dawnguard and hired abunch of mercenaries
                            to look over his son and they would later become known as the Dawnguard. This is where things get foggy. Some say the the mercenaries had to put down the Jarl's son and then got 
                            banished from the hold, but continued their vampiric hunt until the threat of vampires had begun to be disregarded by the peopleand they broke up. Other's say the mercenaries saw
                            the power the Jarl's son had due to his vampirism and decided to join him and they would hunt in the hold until they all got hunted down. During the events of The Elder Scrolls V,
                            the Dawnguard are introduced with the Dawnguard DLC as they are being rebuilt by a man named Isran. Some people are skeptical of the threat of vampires and others run to Fort Dawnguard
                            to help fight them. In the DLC, you are approached by Durak, another Dawnguard member, to join the cause. You help fight vampires as well as become friends with one. Her name is Seranna
                            and she is a massive fan favorite. Seranna asks you to take her home and this is where you can join the Volkihar Clan if you so choose. You discover a plot by the vampires to obtain
                            an acient elven artifact known as Auri-el's Bow. The vampires want to corrupt the bow and use it blot out the sun, making it forever night. No matter if you join the Volkihar or stick
                            with the Dawnguard, you can either choose to give the bow Lord Harkon, the leader of the Volkihar and Seranna's father, to blot out the sun or kill Lord Harkon and save the world.

                        Volkihar Clan
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Volkihar Clan are the nightmares of myth and legend. They are said to be the oldest and most powerful vampire clan ever. It isn't really known exactly how old the clan is, but 
                            they started when Lord Harkon pledged his life to Molag Bal and in reutrn, Bal made Harkon and his family pure-blooded vampires. Legends of the clan tell stories of the vampires living
                            underneath the ice of Skyrim, breaking out to steal their victims away and feed, but they live in a massive castle off the north east coast of Skyrim and send some to blend in with men 
                            and mer and feed while people sleep. If you join the Volkihar in the Dawnguard DLC, you fight rival vampire clans and the Dawnguard. The story remains pretty much the same with finding
                            Auri-el's Bow and either stopping Harkon's plan or help him, your just a member of the Volkihar instead of the Dawnguard.

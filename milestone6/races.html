                        <p>
                            Nords are the humans native to Skyrim, a harsh, frozen are in the north of Tamriel. They are tall and fair-haired people and descend from ancient Atmorans who 
                            migrated from the now frozen continent of Atmora. Nords are very independent are honor-bound, valuing loyalty, bravery,
                            and strength. They respect those who die in battle and frown upon people that die of natural causes. They believe that
                            after death, their souls are transported to Sovngarde, a huge mead hall overseen by Shor. Some nords can be racist towards elves and beastfolk. The nords in The Elder Scrolls
                            is heavily influenced by norse and viking culture in the real world. Nords in The Elder Scrolls are very skilled in melee
                            combat, especially two-handed weaponry. Additionally, they are naturally resistant to the cold and frost magic, thanks to
                            their Atmoran descendants. Their resitance definitely comes in handy in the province of Skyrim.

                        <p>
                            Imperials human race like the nords. They come from the province of Cyrodiil, the center of Tamriel. They are known for their
                            diplomacy, organization, and tactics. Think of them as the equivalent to the Roman Empire in The Elder Scrolls. They are considered
                            to be more urbanized and civilized than the other races, and have a niche for commerce and persuasion. The imperial armies are 
                            extremely strategic and formidable. They are controlled by the Septim Empire, who has ruled over Tamriel for centuries. The imperials 
                            worship the Nine Divines. One of the divines, Talos, was once an imperial human named Tiber Septim and emperor of the Septim Empire.
                            In the games, the imperials have a passive effect, meaning that it is always active, in which they are more likely to find more gold 
                            than other races and have "Voice of the Emperor", which calms down enemies for 30 seconds.

                        <p>
                            Redgaurds are a dark-skinned human race who hail from the desert province of Hammerfell. Like the nords, the redgaurds aren't 
                            orginally from Tamirel, but instead another lost continent, Yokuda. Yokuda sank into the sea and the redguards sailed east to 
                            Hammerfell and eventually conquered the land and absorb the native dwemer population. The redguards are considered very 
                            independent, even more so than the nords. Hammerfell in fact, is the only province in Tamirel that is completely independent 
                            from the the Empire. Redgaurds are have a history of being warriors, sailors, and explorers. They have a natural resistance to 
                            poison and are unmatched with their skill in comabt with one-handed weapons. Like the nords, they believe in 
                            strength, honor in combat, and are very proud of their ancestry. The redguard pantheon is different from the nine divines, but
                            some redguards incorporate those beliefs depending on where they live.

                        <p>
                            Bretons are the hyrbid race from the coastal province of High Rock in Tamriel. They are a mix of the Nedes, early humans, and the 
                            Direnni, old high elves. Thanks to their mix of blood, they have a natural affinity for melee and magical combat. Bretons have a 
                            natural resistance to magic and are especially gifted in conjuration magic. Many bretons are battlemages and wizards, but some are 
                            spellblades, blending armor and swords with magic, much like their mix of blood. Breton culture is much like medieval europe with 
                            kingdoms, noble houses, court politics, and sometimes literal backstabbing. They are percieved as crafty and manipultive, mainly by
                            orcs and nords because they tend to win with strategy instead of brute force, among other things. Breton religion follows the Nine 
                            Divines, but some also worship elven deities because of their duel ancestry.

                        Bosmer / Wood Elves
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            In The Elder Scrolls elves are also known as Mer. The Bosmer are wood elves. Bosmer means "Tree-Sap People" in their language. They 
                            are all about nature, stealth, and freedom. They don't believe in empires and resist control. The bosmer are from the province 
                            Valenwood, a dense jungle in the southwest of Tamriel. They follow the Green Pact. A pact stating that they will never harm the plant 
                            life of Valenwood. This goes so far that they only eat meat, this inlcudes fallen enemies. Ritualistic cannibalism. They perform rites 
                            over their dead that also involve cosuming them. It is part of their worship for their god of nature, Y'ffre. Their armor and tools 
                            are all made of bone, stone, or leather. In Valenwood, they live in the massive, living trees that cover the land. Outside of Valenwood, 
                            Bosmer don't need to follow the Green Pact as it is only binding to Valenwood, but are expected to follow them as close as possible. 
                            In combat, most bosmer choose archery and stealth as they are naturally fast and agile. These skills come in handy if they want to be 
                            an assassin or a theif, which some do.

                        <p>
                            The Dunmer or Dark Elves are a grey-skinned, red-eyed people that come from the volcanic, harsh province of Morrwind in Tamriel. They 
                            were once known as the Chimer and had gold skin instead of their now gray skin. The daedric prince Azura cursed the dunmer with red 
                            eyes and covered their skin in ash, "grey-skinned", for bertraying her. Most dunmer currently worship the daedra, but they used to worship 
                            the Tribunal, Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil who were mortal gods, and their worship ended after the events of the game The Elder Scrolls 
                            III: Morrowind. The dunmer are considered very intense people. They come off as racist and supremacist, especially towards the beast races.
                            The racism towards the beastfolk is tied with the dunmer's history of slavery. The dunmer society in Morrwind is divided into houses, House 
                            Redoran, Telvanni, Hlaalu, Indoril, and Dres. Each house is known for its own unique ideology and power. In combat, dunmer have a natural 
                            resistance to fire and a lot are very skilled in destruction magic, especially those in House Telvanni. Many dunmer are also known to be 
                            assassins and are great in stealth.

                        <p>
                            Altmer means High Folk in their tounge. The altmer hail from the Summerset Isles, an island nation southwest of Tamirel. The altmer are 
                            very well known for being arrogant, perfectionists, and extremely racist towards every other race. They believe they are the purest 
                            descendant of Aedra, which makes them superior. They believe all other races to be spiritually and genetically inferior, especially humans.
                            They are originally isolationists until recently with the rise of the Aldmeri Dominion or the Thalmor. Despite the racism, the altmer are 
                            actually very educated and refined. They are considered THE magic race. From the moment they altmer are born they thrown deep into magical 
                            education and are naturally supremely skilled at it. In the games, they have a +50 towards their starting magicka. Most if not all altmer 
                            are mages and if any do use weapons, they are most likely magically conjured weapons.

                        <p>
                            Orsimer means Pariah Folk in elvish. Orcs are from all around Tamriel, but Orsinium, Orc-Town, is a prominent location for orc kind. All orcs 
                            worship the daedric prince Malacath. Malacath used to be known as Trinimac, but he was eaten and corrupted by Boethiah. After this happened, 
                            the orsimer were changed, both physically and culturally. Orcs have very strong warrior traditions and don't believe in dying of old age. Instead 
                            they leave their strongholds and go seek what they call a good death to join Malacath in his plane of oblivion. Each stronghold follows a chieftain 
                            system and each stronghold is ruled by one chief. The chief is usually the strongest orc in the stronghold and is the only one allowed a wife. The 
                            entirety of orc society revolves around strength and the survival of their strongholds. Failure in a stronghold most often leads to exile and most of those
                            are exiled become mercenaries or blacksmiths. Orcs are very often viewed as aggresive and unintelligent with a few excpetions such as Urog gro-Shub,
                            a mage in the college of Winterhold. The aggresivness of orcs matches their combat style. Orcs are definitely melee focused and are considered tanks, 
                            using heavy armor and two-handed weaponry.

                        <p>
                           The story of the snow elves is tragic. The snow elves and falmer are considered different, but are technically the same. The snow elves were a race of elves 
                           that lived in Skyrim long ago, before the Nords sailed from Atmora. In the beginning, the snow elves and nords were peaceful and worked together, until something 
                           called the Night of Tears, in which the snow elves attacked the Nordic city of Saarthal. The reasons for the attack were unclear and remain that way. Ysgramor, a
                           famous nord warrior, went back to Atmora and returned to Skyrim with 500 companions and pushed the snow elves onto the brink of extinction. In a desperate move to 
                           save themselves, the snow elves went to the dwemer for salvation. The dwemer agreed to let them in, but the snow elves were forced to eat a fungus that made them 
                           go blind and become severly dependent on the dwemer. This is where we now call them the Falmer.

                            The Falmer are completely blind and rely on their hearing to get around. They still remain in the dwarven ruins even though the dwarves disappeared. They now look 
                            monstrous, have pale skin, are hunched over, and thin. While the falmer did essentially devolve, they still show a sort of intelligence, having a sort of hierarchy, 
                            with what looks like some falmer commanding other. They build huts, tools, and armor with chitin from the terrifying chaurus creatures that they also use a pets. 
                            They appear to perform rituals and even make small statues that seem to have an unknown significance. In the Dawnguard DLC in Skyrim, you find out that there are 
                            actually two surviving snow elves. One that has been corrupted and became a vampire and his brother, who stuck to the path of light and followed the go Auri-el. You 
                            also find out another name for the falmer, the Betrayed.

                            Dwemer are also known as the dwarves or deep elves. The dwemer primarily occupied Morrowind, Skyrim, and Hammerfell and live in underground cities.
                            The dwemer believed that gods shouldn't be worshipped and that they were in fact equal. This viewpoint can be seen as fair because the dwemer were 
                            extremely inelligent, being the engineers of incredible technology that could have had something to do with their disappearance. The dwemer mysteriously
                            disappeared around 700 of the 1st Era during the Battle of Red Mountain. The dwemer were attempting their greatest machine yet, a god-like machine they

                            using his tools Sunder, Keening, and Wraithguard to manipulate the Heart. After this, somehting happened and the dwemer were gone and noone has seen them

                            Argonians are the reptilian beastfolk of Black Marsh, a swampy land southeast of Tamriel. Argonians have a natural resistance to diseases and poison, 
                            and can breathe underwater. Most argonians are skilled in roles like theiving and assassination, but some go in different directions. The argonian race 
                            is spiritually and biologically linked to ancient sentient trees only native to Black Marsh, the Hist. These trees shape argonian culture, identity, and 
                            physiology. When an argonian hatches, it drinks the sap from the Hist and this infulences their development. The bond between is strong and sacred, the 
                            Hist will even guide argonians with visions or dreams and severing this connection is considered very offensive. Argonians have a long history of being 
                            oppressed and put into slavery, especially by the dunmer.

                            Khajiits are a feline beastfolk in the province of Elsweyr in Tamriel. The khajiiti culture and how their appearance works is very interesting. Khajiits 
                            17 different possible forms they can be born into and this depends on the phase of the moons. They call this system the Lunar Lattice or ja-Kha'jay in 
                            their language. Their are the Suthay, Cathay, Dagi, Alfiq, Senche, Ohmes, Tojay, Pahmar, and the raht counter parts to all of those. The 17th form is 
                            called Mane and is the rarest as they can only be born when the moons Masser and Secunda align and in legend, a thrid moon appears. The other forms can 
                            range from looking like a cat-human hybrid(Sathay and Sathay-raht), a house cat(Alfiq and Alfiq-raht), or looking more like an elf and have no fur(Ohmes).
                            Khajiiti people are seen as shady and drug-dealers and this stereotype has made it so khajiits can not enter cities in Skyrim. While some try and stir away 
                            from this stereotype and become merchants or mages like J'zargo, some accept this stereotype and can often be seen with the Theives Guild. Additionally, 
                            khajiits speak in the thrid person due to their native language.

                            Not much is known about the continent of Akavir, but the Akaviri did go to Tamriel. The akaviri were humanoid warriors and most of the history about them was 
                            destroyed. What is known is that the akaviri flew to Tamriel on Dragons, another race of Akavir. The akaviri had something known as the Dragonguard and this 
                            guard created Sky Haven Temple as an outpost in Skyrim.

                        <p>
                            Dragons are believed to be the children of the god of time, Akatosh, who is depcited as a dragon himself. Dragons were originally from Akavir and were flewn to
                            Tamriel by the akaviri. Dragons in Akavir would eventually become extinct and it was believed that the Dragonguard killed them. Any who escaped went to Tamriel 
                            were worshipped as gods. The dragons would reward their most obedient subjects as Dragon Priests. Eventually there was an attempt to overthrow the dragons by a 
                            dragon priest named Miraak. His rebellion failed and after that the dragons and priests ruled harsher then ever before. Near the end of the dragon-cult reign, 
                            the leader of the cult, Alduin the World Eater, was banished through time and space by a group of nords with the help of another dragon Paarthurnax. The dragons 
                            who survived the rebellion would move to remote areas to stay away from man and mer. However, in the 4th Era, the dragons would return along with Alduin and terrorize Skyrim.

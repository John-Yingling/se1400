                            High Rock is the north-western province of Tamriel. The capital city is Daggerfall, the largest and southern most city
                            in High Rock. The terrain of High Rock veries from place to place. There are coastal hills, forests, windy crags, and
                            mountain ranges. High Rock borders Hammerfell to its southeast and skyrim to its east. The main inhabitants of High Rock
                            are the Bretons.

                            Hammerfell is the western province of Tamriel. The capital city is Sentinel, a massive port city with heavy navy 
                            presence and busy markets. The terrain in Hammerfell is deserts and rocky highlands with few coastal cities like Sentinel.
                            The deserts in Hammerfell are full of massive sandstorms, dwarven ruins, bandits, and nomadic tribes. The Dragontail Mountains
                            are in the north of Hammerfell and act as a border from other provinces. The montains have many strongholds and mysteries. 
                            Hammerfell borders High Rock to its north, Skyrim to its northeast, and Cyrodiil to its east. The main inhabitants of

                        Skyrim
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            Skyrim is the northern province of Tamriel. The capital city is Solitude, a rich and refined city that also houses the empires
                            main base of operations for Skyrim. The terrain of Skyrim is very harsh. The entire province is snowy tundra, icy coastlines,
                            mountains, and forests full of bandits, ancient nord ruins, dwarven ruins, and old forts. If the draugr of the nord ruins don't 
                            scare you, the falmer will. Skyrim borders High Rock to the west, Hammerfell to the southwest, Cyrodiil to south, and Morrowind
                            to east. The main inhabitants of Skyrim are the Nords.

                    <h3>
                        Morrowind
                    </h3>    
                        <p>
                            Morrowind is the northeastern province of Tamriel. The capital city is Mournhold, the polical hot spot for Morrowind and 
                            houses multiple Tribunual temples. The terrain of Morrowind is alien-like. The province has swamps, forest made up of giant
                            mushrooms, volcanic highlands, and ash covered wastelands. The land used to be terrorized by cliff racers, but they were wiped 
                            out by Saint Jiub. Instead the Reavers plunder the land. Morrowind borders Skyrim to the northwest, Cyrodiil to west, and Black 
                            Marsh to the south. The main inhabitants of Morrowind are the Dunmer, or Dark Elves.

                        <p>
                            Cyrodiil is the central province of Tamriel. The capital city is the Imperial City, a massive city made of white stone and 
                            home of the Empire, surrounded by Lake Rumare. Cyrodiil is probably the nicest province when it comes to climage and geography.
                            Cyrodiil has swamps to their south, snow covered mountain ranges to the north, and the rest is lush forests and beautiful fields,
                            if your not attacked by goblins or trolls. Cyrodiil borders Hammerfell to the west, Skyrim to the north, Morrowind to the east,
                            Black Marsh to the southeast, and Valenwood and Elsweyr to the south. The main inhabitants of Cyrodiil are the Imperials.

                    </h3>    
                        <p>
                            The Summerset Isles is an island province off the southwest coast of Tamriel. The capital city is Alinor, a shining city full of
                            towers and light. The terrain of the Summer Isles is absolutely gorgeous. Golden beaches, crystal waters, coral cliffs, meadows,
                            and strange flora. This would be the perfect summer vacation spot, almost ideal if it weren't for severe racism towards literally
                            every other race by the local population. The Summerset Isles are bordered by the Etheric Ocean and the Abecean Sea. The main 
                            inhabitants of the Summerset Isles are the Altmer, or High Elves.

                            Valenwood is one of the southern provinces of Tamriel. The capital city is Falinesti, a city built a massive living tree that 
                            actually moves around the province. The terrain of Valenwood is very dangerous. The province is full thick forests, jungles, groves,
                            and as discussed, tree cities. The trees are not the only thing living as there are, talking vines as well as many carniverous plants.
                            If the local fauna doesn't kill or eat you, the local populous might, depending on how you treat them and their nature. Valenwood 
                            borders Cyrodiil to the north and Elsweyr to the east. The main inhabitants of Valenwood are the Bosmer, or Wood Elves.

                            Elsweyr is one of the southern provinces of Tamriel. The capital city is Rimmen, an oasis in the northern region of Elsweyr.
                            The terrain of Elsweyr is a 50/50 of desert and jungle. The northern half of Elsweyr is desert full of sandstorms, sand dunes, 
                            and ancient ruins. The southern half of Elsweyr is dense jungle and coasts. If the beasts of the deserts don't kill you, the 
                            ancient spirits will. Elsweyr is bordered by Valenwood to the west, Cyrodiil to the north, and Black Marsh to the east. The 
                            main inhabitants of Elsweyr are the Khajiits.

                            Black Marsh is the southeastern province of Tamriel. Black Marsh doesn't have a true capital city, but the key cities are Lilmoth,
                            Stormhold, and Archon. The terrain of Black Marsh is moist. The entire province is hot, humid, thick jungles, and marshes, hence
                            the name. All the beasts there want to kill you, from the fleshflies, it's exactly as it sounds, to the werecrocodiles, yes people
                            that transform into crocodiles, pretty much nothing is safe. Black Marsh is bordered by Elsweyr to the west, Cyrodiil to the 
                            northwest, and Morrowind to the north. The main inhabitants of Black Marsh are the Argonians

                        There are also accounts of monkey people, vampiric snake-men, tiger-dragon people, and snow demons. This is all that is really

                        After Ysgramor went back to Tamriel with his 500 companions, Atmora was rumored to have frozen over and no one knows why. Expededtions

                        Pyandonea is the continent south of Tamriel and essentially the Atlantis of the Elder Scrolls. Pyandonea is home to the Maomer, or 
                        Sea Elves. The continent is entirely cloaked in myth and is surrounded by deadly, storm-ridden seas, so ships that try and sail 
                        there disappear a lot. The Maomer are very similar to the Altmer, descendants of the same people and extreme hatred towards any
                        race that isn't them. They have actually tired to invade Tamriel multiple times.

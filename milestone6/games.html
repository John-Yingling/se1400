                        The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind came out in 2002. The game takes place in Vvardenfell, in the province of Morrowind during
                            427 of the 3rd Era. You begin as a prisoner (told you) with orders from Emperor Uriel Septim VII. Soon after arriving to 
                            Vvardenfell, you find out about the prophecy of the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of the Dunmer hero Indoril Nerevar. Eventually
                            you discover you are the Nerevarine and must fulfill a bunch of ancient prophecies. You rise the ranks of the three Great Houses
                            and gain the trust of the Ashlander Tribes. After this you discover a secret about the Tribunal and how they betrayed the Nerevar.
                            At the end of the storyline you face off against Dagoth-Ur, a friend of the Nerevar who became an enemy. Wilst all of 
                            that was happening, Dagoth-Ur was using the Heart of Lorkhan to become a god and release the Blight to mutate and corrupt life.
                            <br><br>
                            While the Nerevarine did defeat Dagoth-Ur, his story did not end there as two DLC's were release for Morrowind, Tribunal and
                            Bloodmoon. Tribunal is set in in same year as the main events of Morrowind, but it centralizes in Mournhold, the capital city
                            of Morrowind. The big story of Tribunal is Amalexia, one of the three mortal god-kings of Morrowind, is becoming power hungry and
                            wants to keep her grasp on her people so she orchestrates different crisis in Mournhold to maintain her image. At the end, Amalexia
                            goes full villain and sends you to Sotha Sil's Clockwork City where you find Sotha Sil dead and face off against Amalexia, ending
                            the Tribunal DLC. The Bloodmoon DLC is also in the same year, but takes place on the island of Solstheim. The story for this DLC is
                            that the East Empire Company wants help establishing a new colony called Raven Rock where you can help build, defend, and deal with 
                            polotics. However, there is something else going on. The daedric prince Hircine is about to start something called the Bloodmoon 
                            Prophecy, hence the name. The prophecy involves Hircine's big hunt, where he and many werewolves hunt selected prey. At the end you 
                            face off against Hircine and choose an aspect of his to fight.

                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion came out in 2006. The game takes place in the province of Cyrodiil during 433 of the 3rd Era.
                            You begin as a prisoner (again) and Emperor Uriel Septim VII approaches your cell with his personal guard and he declares that
                            he has seen you in dreams, like a prophecy. The emperor has you accompany him and his guards through a secret passage in your 
                            cell where he is soon assassinated by the Mythic Dawn, a daedric cult who worships Mehrunes Dagon. Before his death, the emperor
                            tells you about a secret heir he has named Martin and you must find him. You find Martin in the city of Kvatch while it is being
                            attacked by daedra through oblivion gates. This is now where the player earns the title the Hero of Kvatch. You take Martin to the 
                            headquarters of the blades to keep him safe. After this you recover the Amulent of Kings, ancient armor of Talos, and rebuild the 
                            Blades. The city of Bruma is then attacked by daedra and you must help defend it. Martin then asks for the Hero of Kvatch's help to
                            perform a ritual to create a new artifact of Akatosh. Mehrunes Dagon then attacks the Imperial City himself and Martin saccrifces 
                            himself, turning himslef into a giant flaming dragon to defeat Mehrunes Dagon and send him back to his plane of oblivion.

                            Just like Morrowind though, Oblivion got some DLC content, the Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles. The Knights of the Nine
                            DLC is about an ancient Ayleid king, Umaril the Unfeathered, returning from the dead. Umaril has his warriors killing priests of the
                            Nine Divines and in the Hero of Kvatchs quest to stop Umaril, they reform the Knights of the Nine. Eventually you find Umaril in his
                            fortress and you kill him and then use a holy artifact to follow him to the spiritual plane and kill him their as well. The Shivering 
                            Isles DLC takes place in the Shivering Isles, the daedric prince of madness Sheogoraths plane of oblivion. A portal appears in Niben 
                            Bay and you go to the Shivering Isles where Sheogorath warns you about an incoming event called the Greymarch, in which Jyggalag, the 
                            daedric prince of order, destroys the Shivering Isles. Sheogorath asks the Hero of Kvatch to help prevent the Greymarch. In this process
                            you help the lands of Mania and Dementia and discover that Sheogorath disappears and the Greymarch beings and you take Sheogorath's 
                            place as the prince of madness. You eventually find out that Sheogorath and Jyggalag are the same person. Jyggalag was cursed by the other
                            daedra to become Sheogorath. Essentially Sheogorath is stuck in a cycle of turning into Jyggalag and destroying his own realm and 
                            repeating the process. After you take Sheogoraths place, you fight Jyggalag and defeat him breaking the curse and Jyggalag is now free
                            to roam the planes of oblivion. The Hero of Kvatch then is crowned the new Sheogorath and actually shows up in the next Elder Scrolls game.

                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released in 2011. The game takes place in the province of Skyrim during 201 of the 4th Era. You begin as 
                            a prisoner (figures) being transported to Helgen for execution along side about a dozen stormcloak soldiers and Ulfric Stormcloak. Right 
                            before the headsmans axe hits your neck, the town is attacked by a dragon. After you escape Helgen, you make your way to Riverwood then to
                            Whiterun where the court wizard asks you to retrieve a stone tablet from an ancient nord barrow. Once you return with the tablet the Jarl 
                            gets news that there is a dragon attacking one of their watchtowers and asks you to help fight. You go with a couple of city guards and fight
                            and kill the dragon. Something weird happens though and the guards believe that you devooured the dragons soul and that makes you Dragonborn,
                            a person blessed with blood of the dragons and the natural gift of the Thu'um, dragon shouts. The Dragonborn is then summoned by the Greybeards,
                            a group of men dedicated to peace and mastery of the Thu'um. The Greybeards train the dragonborn and send him to retrieve the Horn of Jorgen
                            Windcaller only to discover that it was stolen by someone named Delphine, an old member of the Blades. After you retrieve the horn from her and
                            return to the Greybeards, your training with them is done. Delphine though, asks you to help her at a dragon burial site and you witness Alduin,
                            the dragon that attacked Helgen in the beginning, resurrecting a dragon that you then fight. After Delphine is convinced that you are the Dragonborn,
                            she tasks you with breaking into the Thalmor embassy to see if they have anything to do with the dragons returning, they don't she's just a 
                            little prejiduce towards the Thalmor (for good reasons, most players are). You don't find anything on the Thalmor and the dragons, but you do find 
                            out that another member of the Blades, Esbern, is alive and hiding in Riften. You go find him and the Dragonborn, Delphine, and Esbern got an 
                            ancient Akaviri temple to read the prophecy of Alduin's return tp find any clues of how to defeat him. You find an ancient shout called
                            Dragonrend that can take dragons from out of the sky. To learn this shout you go to Blackreach, a long lost underground dwarven civilization, 
                            to find an Elder Scroll and go back in time to witness Alduin's banishment. You learn the shout and once you return Alduin shows up and 
                            the two of you fight. After defeating him, Alduin goes to Sovngarde to hide. The Dragonborn captures a dragon in Dragonsreach and uses that
                            dragon to travel to Skaldafn, an ancient nord ruin with a portal to Sovngarde. The Dragonborn travels to Sovngarde to defeat Alduin and 
                            returns to Nirn.
                            <br><br>
                            The Elder Scrolls V also got some DLC content in the form of the Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn, and Creation Club. The Dawnguard DLC revolves
                            around the return of the vampire threat. In the DLC you can side with the Dawnguard, vampire hunters, or the Volkihar vampires. No matter which
                            side you choose the story is pretty much the same. Lord Harkon, the leader of the Volkihar wants to bring about a prophecy to blot out the sun. 
                            In this process you discover an ancient artifact called Auri-el's Bow which can be used to blot out the sun. Once you find the bow you can either 
                            give it to Lord Harkon to fulfill the prophecy or kill Lord Harkon and stop the prophecy from coming ture. The Hearthfire DLC is just a home
                            building simulator. You can build homes and adopt children and pets. The Dragonborn DLC is based on the island of Solstheim and the return of 
                            Miraak, the dragon priest that tried to take over the dragons and rule on his own. When you first arrive to Solstheim some people are acting 
                            almost like zombies. They are being controlled by Miraak from Apocrypha, Hermeus Mora's plane of oblivion. The Dragonborn goes all throughout 
                            Solstheim in search of Black Books, items of Hermeus Mora. You eventually find the right book to take you to Miraak and you defeat him and
                            become Hermeus Mora's new champion. The Creation Club isn't actually a DLC, but it's a microtransaction shop that can add new items into the game,
                            some of the items being a sort of mini DLC, but nothing to game changing.

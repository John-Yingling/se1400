                        <p>
                            Akatosh is the god of time and first of the gods of the Nine Divines. He is often depicted as a golden dragon
                            and he is the father of all dragons. Akatosh can bless men with the blood and soul of a dragon making them Dragonborns.
                            The first Dragonborn was named Miraak, but how he got the powers of Dragonborn isn't made clear. The entire Septim
                            bloodline is made up of Dragonborns since Akatosh created the Amulet of Kings for Alessia and blessed her with the 
                            dragon blood. Akatosh can start events known as Dragon Breaks. Dragon Breaks are when the timeline of Nirn is split
                            and since Akatosh is a dragon and not just the god of time, but time himself, it is seen as breaking the dragon.
                            There have been three Dragon Breaks in recorded history, but they are hard to identify because people are usually 
                            unaware of when they happen. Akatosh is also thoght to Auri-El in the elven pantheon.

                            Azura is the daedric prince of dusk and dawn. Despite being a daedra, who are considered evil and demonic, Azura is 
                            actually considered to be the most benevolent of the daedric princes. Azura's daedric artifact is Azura's Star, a
                            soul gem that never breaks and can capture white souls. However, in Skyrim, in Azura's daedric quest you can change
                            the fate of Azura's Star, making it The Black Star. It's similar to Azura's star where it will never break, the 
                            difference is that The Black Star can only capture black souls, the souls of men and mer. Her other artifact is
                            The Ring of Azura and gives the wearer night vision. Her plane of oblivion is Moonshadow, the most beautiful realm

                            Emperor Titus Mede II was rumored to have wielded Goldbrand in battle when taking back the Imperial City from the

                            Clavicus Vile is the daeric prince of deals, pacts, and desire. The trick with Clavicus Vile is that when you make
                            a deal with him, expect there to be a trick somewhere. Clavicus Vile's daedric artifacts are the Bitter Cup, 
                            Masque of Clavicus Vile, Rueful Axe, and Umbra Sword. The Bitter Cup is considered highly sacred by Clavicus's 
                            followers and was thought to be lost in the ruins Ald Redaynia. The Masque of Clavicus Vile was made when a 
                            disfigured noblewoman made a deal with Clavicus to make her beautiful. Clavicus gave her the mask and people began
                            to love and admire. She eventually got married and became pregnant, but Clavicus returned and took his mask back and 
                            the noblewoman was then kicked out by her husband. The Rueful Axe was given to a man by Clavicus Vile when he asked
                            Clavicus to help cure his daughter of lycanthropy. The Umbra Sword was a sword that Clavicus Vile asked Naenra Waerr
                            to make and trap souls. Clavicus put some of his essence in the sword and that essence became sentient, calling itself
                            Umbra. Anyone who wields the sword starts calling themselves Umbra, like they were taken over. Clavicus's plane of 
                            oblivion is called The Fields of Regret, a land that smells of perfume and rotting flesh.

                            someone close to them. The Ring of Khajiit is a ring used a lot by thieves because of its ability to make the wearer 
                            invisible. Mephala's plane of oblivion is The Spiral Skein, a land held together almost like a web, centered around 
                            The Pillar Palace of Mephala, though that's not its actual name.

                            Meridia is the daedric prince of light and morality. Meridia is also considered one of the more benevolent daedra, 
                            much like Azura. Meridia is also extremely against the undead, she hates them with a passion. Meridia's only daedric
                            artifact is Dawnbreaker, a one-handed sword infused with light, setting anyone hit by it on fire, and if it used to
                            kill undead, they explode. Meridia's plane of oblivion is the Colored Rooms, not one plane, but a collection belonging
                            to Meridia where little is actually known about them.

                            Molag Bal is the daedric prince of domination and slavery. Molag Bal has the power of turning mortals into vampires.
                            Molag Bal's only daedric artifact is the Mace of Molag Bal, a demonic weapon with a depiction of Bal's face on it. 
                            Molag Bal's plane of oblivion is Coldharbour, said to be an exact copy of Nirn, but in ruins. The sky is said to be on

                            is really known about it because any men or mer that verntured there never came back.

                            uses to see into the mortal plane. The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal was a cowl owned by Nocturnal that was stolen by a thief
                            and she cursed it so anyone that wears it, their identity is erased from history. The cowl is worn by the leader of the 
                            Thieves Guild called the Gray Fox. The Skeleton Key is an unbreakable lockpick owned by Nocturnal that is dreamed of

                            Sheogorath is the daedric prince of madness. Sheogorath is actually one half of a daedra, the other being Jyggalag. An
                            event called the Greymarch occurs every now and then where Sheogorath becomes Jyggalag and destroys Sheo's plane of
                            oblivion over and over again. This loop is ended during the events of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Shivering Isles
                            DLC, in which the Hero of Kvatch helps stop the Greymarch and Jyggalag and literally becomes the new Sheogorath. 
                            Sheogorath has many daedric artifacts. They are the Wabbajack, Staff of the Everscamp, Fork of Horripilation, Spear of
                            Bitter Mercy, Staff of Sheogorath, Gambolpuddy, and Follum Discognitum. The Wabbajack is a staff that when used has 
                            random things happen to whoever it is used against. This can range from turning someone into a block of cheese to 
                            summoning an angry dremora that attacks you. The Staff of the Everscamp summons four everscamps and if one is killed,
                            a new one takes its place, but only for a short amount of time. The staff also can't be dropped or sold and can only be
                            gotten rid of if you the wielder gives it someone who is willing to take it. The Fork of Horripilation is literally 
                            just a fork that drains someones magicka. The Spear of Bitter Mercy is able to reflect magical attacks back at the 
                            attacker and can summon a storm atronach. The Staff of Sheogorath has the ability to freeze opponents in a certain 
                            range. Sheogorath's voive booms from the staff when activated saying "Hold!" to freeze everyone and "Release!" when
                            the spell wears off. Gambolpuddy is a right glove that when worn fortifies half of the wearers skills while also 
                            draining the rest. Folium Discognitum is book that is full of the insigths of people who have gone insane and can
                            give the reader immense knowledge. Sheogorath's plane of oblivion is the Shivering Isles. It is whatever Sheogorath
                            wills it to be.

                            Jyggalag is the daedric prince of order. Jyggalag used to be the most powerful daedric prince until the other daedra
                            began to fear him and his power. The other princes cursed Jyggalag to turn into Sheogorath, the complete opposite of
                            everything he stands for. At the end of the Shivering Isles DLC and the cycle of Greymarch is ended, Jyggalag is set 
                            free and he can now roam the planes of oblivion again. Jyggalag has only one daedric artifact, the Sword of Jyggalag,
                            a powerful two-handed sword that belongs to Jyggalag. Jyggalag's plane of oblivion is technically the Shivering Isles,
                            but because of his split personality he doesn't really get the chance to be in it.

                <h4>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</h4>
                    <p>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, or UESP, has an overall lore page broken up into different sections such as Artifacts, Death, Gods, and History 
                    that includes all information from all the games and books. It goes further by putting the letters A to Z with links
                    directing to a page that give everything that starts with that letter in the category you clicked in. For instance,
                    if you go to gods and click on A, you'll be directed to a page with every god in the elder scrolls that starts with A,
                    like Akatosh, Ark'ay, and Azura. They do include pictures for some of the items on their website, but not all of them.
                    This is something I would like to do differently by trying to have pictures for everything.<br><br>For the style of their                        site, they made it look like an old paper map with beige coloring and used a regular font. I think the old map look is an
                    cool concept, but the font they used just doesn't fit with the map look. In the fifth elder scrolls game, Skyrim, they 
                    used a font called Viner Hand ITC on any items that were supposed to be handwritten like notes, books, or maps. I think
                    using the same font would've been an amazing choice. If I were to go with the map look for my website, (I don't think I will),
                    I would use Viner Hand ITC.</p>
                <h4>Fandom - Elder Scrolls</h4>
                    <p>Fandom is a website with video game lore and information of multiple games, but I am going to focus on their Elder Scrolls
                    specific page. All pages the Elder Scrolls Fandom has, has a dark themed background with the logo for The Elder Scrolls Online.
                    The top and left side of the page are these dark purple side bars, with the top having a search bar to look what video game you
                    want to find and a directory to the home page and the left having an explore tab, fan central, and then a tab that shows what 
                    others have looked at on the page you are currently on. The Elder Scrolls main page has a table of contents with each section
                    and then sub sections that go further into the topic, listed like 1., 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.2, 2., etc. I have to say that I personally
                    love this look and set up quite a bit more than the other page. Purple is my favorite color, so that could be adding some bias,
                    but the the colors just work really well together. I think the only change I would make is the font again. I would probably use 
                    a font from the games that is used in their UI.</p>

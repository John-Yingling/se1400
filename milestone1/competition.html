                <h4>The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</h4>
                    <p>This site has an overall lore page broken up into different sections such as Artifacts, Death, Gods, and History 
                    that includes all information from all the games and books. It goes further by putting the letters A to Z with links
                    directing to a page that give everything that starts with that letter in the category you clicked in. For instance,
                    if you go to gods and click on A, you'll be directed to a page with every god in the elder scrolls that starts with A,
                    like Akatosh, Ark'ay, and Azura.</p>

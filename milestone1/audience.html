                <p> The Elders Scrolls series has been a long on going series since the first games release in 1994 under the title of The Elder Scrolls: Arena.
                The most recent game in the series was The Elder Scrolls Online and has sold around 20 million copies and has 5 million monthly players.

                the company who developed the games, Bethesda Softworks, is an American company. Seeing as how the game series has been out for 30+ years
                the age demographic varies. While I can't find anything specifically on the Elder Scrolls, the gender demographic for the elder scrolls is 
                most likely a little more male than female when looking at video game gender statisitcs.</p>
